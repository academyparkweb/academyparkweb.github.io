                    <p>It is with heavy hearts and great sadness that we have to announce the passing of Dr. Stephen Nichalson on Sunday, June 5th. Steve was a gift to all those who were lucky enough to know him and to the children and families he helped care for. A gift taken away too soon. He will be greatly missed by all.</p>

                    <p>Choosing a pediatrician to care for the medical needs of your child is a critical decision for a parent. It is important to choose someone who is qualified, caring, attentive, and approachable. You also want someone who is up-to-date on the latest developments in pediatric and adolescent medical care. At Academy Park Pediatrics these tenets hold true for each and every provider and staff person...for the last 75 years.</p>
                    <p>Our website has been designed to summarize the services we provide, keep you up to date on evolving medical issues relevant to you and your child, and even tell you a little bit about our personal selves. In addition you will find multiple links to reliable child medical care resources on the internet as well as useful routine handouts that you can print.</p>
